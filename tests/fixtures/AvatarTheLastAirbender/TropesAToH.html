When she found out and confronted Ozai about it, he points out a part in one of her letters where she says Zuko is her former lover's son.

No word on whether that was the intention from the beginning or if they were just retroactively trying to find characters that fit. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/TheOtherWiki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/TheOtherWiki">The Other Wiki</a> says that Toph's name actually means 'supported Lotus' in Mandarin.</li><li> Azula's name <em>looks</em> Japanese, except for the fact that it contains the letter 'l'. Her name was originally going to be "Zula" (to mirror Zuko), but was changed to Azula to capture the Spanish word Azul (blue) and create a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulName">Meaningful Name</a> for the girl slinging blue fire around, albeit one which is left-field in a world that is obviously South and East Asian-themed. Alternatively, in keeping to the Japanese language, you can use the r/l switch and get yet another <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulName">Meaningful Name</a> for "blue."</li><li> It would seem that Azula was named after her grandfather Azulon, who is named after Azulong, or The Azure Dragon of the East, a Chinese constellation symbol.</li></ul></li><li> Double points for Zuko, whose name is not only both a Japanese and Chinese name, but is also a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulName">Meaningful Name</a> in both languages. In Japanese, the name 'Zuko' also means "sound of swishing swords", clearly in reference to both his swords and skilled swordsmanship. In addition, there are numerous ways to write Zuko's name in Chinese, one of which is '&#35918;&#39641;' (literally 'standing tall'). This can also be interpreted as 'Conceited, proud of one's self', which fits his character rather nicely for a good portion of Season 1.<ul><li> Zuko is also fairly close to the Filipino word "Suko," which can mean "madness" or "angry" in one dialect, or "surrender" in another. While the second meaning doesn't fit him, the first meaning definitely does, especially in the first season.</li></ul></li><li> In the episode "The Serpent's Pass" the travelers who are being escorted through the Serpent's Pass decide to name their child born just after they reach the other side Hope.</li><li> One of the partygoers in "The Beach" is named "Ruon-Jian." It's pronounced <a class="urllink" href="https://www.ronjonsurfshop.com">"Ron Jon"<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.</li><li> Zuko's mom is named Ursa, which is Latin for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MamaBear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MamaBear">bear</a>.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop">An Aesop</a>: Lots of them, as expected from a kids' show. Many, many episodes have morals to impart, such as "The Kyoshi Warriors" ("sexism is bad"), "The Fortuneteller" ("we make our own destiny"), and "The Deserter" ("impatience is bad"). Few of them are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenAesop">broken</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostAesop">lost</a>, or otherwise faulty.<ul><li> One of the themes of the story overall is that taking shortcuts will just lead to more trouble. Every time a character tries to take the quick and easy path the result is disaster. Examples include both Aang and Zuko trying to learn advanced firebending when they haven't got the basics down, the Earth Kingdom general trying to induce Aang into the Avatar State by threatening a third party only for him to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyRight">get exactly what he wanted</a>, The events of the Day Of Black Sun where the other nations try to end the war before Aang has mastered the elements, and so on. Conversely patience is shown as a virtue, exemplified by Bumi's lesson to Aang on the subject of neutral jing. Positive jing is attacking, negative jing is retreating and neutral jing is doing nothing at all until the time is right to use either positive or negative jing.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffectionateParody" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffectionateParody">Affectionate Parody</a>: The Boulder, a paper-thin parody of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProfessionalWrestling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProfessionalWrestling">pro wrestlers</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DwayneJohnson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DwayneJohnson">Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/HulkHogan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/HulkHogan">Hulk Hogan</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RandySavage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RandySavage">Randy Savage</a>.

Sokka and Katara come up with evidence that pokes a number of holes in the villagers' story, but when the judge is about to deliver a verdict, Kyoshi's soul briefly takes over Aang's body to... admit that she did kill the king, because said king was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssholeVictim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssholeVictim">a tyrant conqueror who threatened her group</a>.

She ran away from the Northern to the Southern Tribe to avoid him and the Northern Tribe's traditions, and Pakku grew incredibly bitter and misogynistic as a result. It appears to have been the traditions were the problem rather than Pakku's person, however, because months after Pakku - having had a change of heart after meeting Katara and realizing Kanna's actual reasons to leave - traveled to the Southern Tribe, he and Kanna <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewOldFlame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewOldFlame">properly got married</a>, this time in mutual love.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual">According to the old official site</a>, Princess Ursa was arranged to be married to Prince Ozai, who was her perfect match.

Comets are seen for days or possibly weeks as they take their sweet time to fly around the sun, are made of much more ice and earth than fire, and <em>rarely</em> intersect the atmosphere and live to tell their tale again. There is a class of objects that do&mdash;Earth-grazing fireballs&mdash;but "Sozin's Earthgrazer" isn't anywhere near as poetic, and doesn't carry that ancient "comets are harbingers of doom" mystique. In addition, the distinction wasn't always as clear in our world, either, so a culture with no advanced astronomy could easily just call any flying space object comets, and the word "comet" comes from Ancient Greek, the language of a culture in which people also thought the world consisted of a total of four (guess which) elements.</li><li> Real total solar eclipses are not at all as rare as the show makes them out to be - they must happen at least once every 5 years, but can go centuries before recurring at the same location. Before the team could have used the planetarium to show when an eclipse would happen over the Fire Nation, they would therefore have had to program it to show the sky at that location.<ul><li> In the days just before the eclipse, the moon is shown full or near-full several times. A solar eclipse can only happen during a new moon, when the moon is on the same side of the Earth as the sun.</li></ul></li><li> A similar issue appears in "The Siege of the North." Despite being located at the north pole, the sun rises and sets as it would below the arctic line. As mentioned in "The Boy in the Iceberg" by Sokka, midnight sun does in fact exist in the world of the Avatar. As such, for day and night to cycle during a normal twenty four hour period in the north pole is not plausible around the solstices. That said, it was not said how long after the winter solstice it was until Aang and his friends reached the North Pole.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtMajorPhysics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtMajorPhysics">Art Major Physics</a>:<ul><li> Fire does not have a concussive effect unless it is part of an explosion, and even then it's the rapidly expanding gases (fire is a form of plasma) that cause the person or object to be pushed back.</li><li> Mai's daggers should not cause people to go flying back into walls unless she's somehow <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XMen">Gambit</a> in disguise.

The rest of the Freedom Fighters, Ty Lee, and Mai are implied to have gone through this - all of the Freedom Fighters are orphans who have been hurt by the war, Mai withdrew into herself as a result of her oppressive childhood, and Ty Lee snapped and ran away to the circus because she was treated like she had no personal identity. Even <em>Azula</em> could arguably fall under this - her deep desire for her parent's affection, likely based on her mother's unspoken preference for Zuko, is part of what makes her the monster she is during the show.<ul><li> Don't forget Appa and Hama.

In "Daydreams and Nightmares" it's put on a tree so Aang can train.</li><li> "Boomerang! You <em>do</em> always come back!"</li><li> To a lesser extent, Sokka's original nickname for Combustion Man kind of fits. In the first half of the episode "The Runaway", there's an apparent throwaway gag where Sokka giddily tells the group he came up with the nickname "Sparky Sparky Boom Man"; he mostly just gets ignored as Toph and Katara continue arguing. Then toward the end of the episode when Combustion Man makes a surprise attack, Aang, with a completely straight face, delivers the line "It's Sparky Sparky Boom Man!"</li><li> In "Daydreams and Nightmares", Aang has a reoccurring <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotWearingPantsDream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotWearingPantsDream">"Not Wearing Pants" Dream</a> about fighting the Fire Lord only to discover he's not wearing pants, until he eventually gets over it, saying: "No, Fire Lord, it is you who is not wearing pants!"

He sticks his wooden glider to the ground and leaves, and the glider immediately catches a fire and burns, but somehow this terrible heat doesn't bother Aang (or the other members of his gang) at all. So convection clearly exists, but it doesn't appear to affect humans. The creators have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Handwaved" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Handwaved">Handwaved</a> this as Aang using airbending to insulate himself from convection, which would also explain why Aang didn't need to wear warm clothing when visiting the poles while Sokka and Katara did.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConvenientlyAnOrphan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConvenientlyAnOrphan">Conveniently an Orphan</a>: It's eventually a source of some angst, but early on the kids have free rein to go on adventures because their parents are gone.

The Northern Water Tribe isolated themselves while their kins in the south have been battered into a collection of scattered villages whose water benders had been almost hunted to extinction. While the Earth Kingdom still stands, their constantly-losing lands have become ravaged and many of their citizens being enslaved by Fire Nation for menial labor.

Then, Appa is stolen by sandbenders, leaving the gang temporarily stranded in the desert, and remains missing for a large number of episodes. Then when the gang finally reaches Ba Sing Se, they make enemies with the government, mainly Long Feng and the Dai Li, due to their conspiracy to repress any mention of the war, halting the Gaang's plan to get the Earth King's help with the invasion, and the Fire Nation captures the city by the end of the season, thanks in part to Zuko's betrayal of Iroh (which he immediately regrets afterward) and helping Azula.</li><li> Speaking of season 2's finale; when Aang gave up his love for Katara in order to save her by activating the Avatar State, his most powerful trump card.
